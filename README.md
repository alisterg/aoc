This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges using Go.

# Usage

- Ensure Go is installed
- Add execute permissions to `setup.sh`
- Run it with `./setup.sh YEAR DAY` -- e.g. `./setup.sh 2024 1`
- Get the input and problem from the AoC website (TODO: automate this)
